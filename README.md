# OOP-2015-2016-Assignment-2

##Initial Thoughts
The game is to be a relativly simple game incorperating everything we have learned in the first semester.
Some of the examples given that could be used are:
- Space Invaders
- Astroids
- Breakout
- Space War
- Tower Defence

For this assignmnet, since we have till the first week in Febuary, I want to push myself a little bit.

My initial idea is to make a simple town building game. Like a simple version of Banished or similar games.
The basic functionatly I hope to have for the game is, a randomly generated map, a randomly placed town center
(that will act as a stockpile, and generate more workers), to have multiple resources and to be able to assign
people to gather them, to have some basic buildings that give bonus's(house to increase pop, mill to increase
food prod, etc).

If I can get these features implemented to a satisfactory level, I will consider adding more features.
